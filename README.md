Landing Page Project
Project Overview
This project dynamically generates a navigation bar for a landing page by processing an HTML
 file with multiple sections. Using JavaScript, the navigation bar is created based on the sections
 present in the document. As the user scrolls through the page, the corresponding navigation link
 becomes highlighted, reflecting the active section in view. Additionally, a "scroll-to-top"
 button appears once the user scrolls down, allowing them to quickly navigate back to the top.

This project is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree and was developed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.
